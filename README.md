## Why

Task automation is a necessity, especially when looking to make data-driven decisions. And that's what I did with a my CV, I needed a CV that I could easily update, and that was easily accessible when I needed it.

## How

This document was compiled in the **Rmarkdown** environment, using the pandoc library.

And in thanks to Bryan Jenks, I leave his cv repository https://github.com/tallguyjenks/CV for you to review, it was a great help in the creation of my own cv.
